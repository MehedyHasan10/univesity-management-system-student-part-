# univesity-management-system-student-part-


Our project name is University Management System. Here I have done a user part named “Student”. The features of my part are signup, login, home, profile view, profile update, change passwords, assignment upload, permit print, CGPA calculate, search teacher list, course adding logout, about us and retrieve data from database and print. I have used html, javascript, php languages and applied session, cookies, ajax.  In this part there is a front page for the student. There he gets some buttons named login, signup, about the university and contact information. The buttons are connected with the login, signup and other pages. If the user clicked any button he or she can see the pages. There is a registration form. User can signup by giving his information if he don’t have any account. If he already have an account he can direct go to the login page to login. There are one types of header and a single footer. Header contains some buttons such as logout, home, change passwords, view profile, assignment upload, permit print, CGPA calculator and update profile. After logged in user can see the home page.
